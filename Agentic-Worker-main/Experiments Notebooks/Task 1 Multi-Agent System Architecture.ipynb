However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`.

      "To use Spark for parallel training in FLAML, you need to follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Install FLAML and PySpark\n",
      "First, make sure you have FLAML and PySpark installed. You can install them using pip:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "pip install flaml pyspark\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Import the necessary libraries\n",
      "Next, import the required libraries in your Python script:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from flaml import AutoML\n",
      "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Create a SparkSession\n",
      "Create a SparkSession object to connect to your Spark cluster:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "spark = SparkSession.builder \\\n",
      "    .appName(\"FLAML Example\") \\\n",
      "    .getOrCreate()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Load your data into a Spark DataFrame\n",
      "Load your data into a Spark DataFrame. You can use the `spark.read` method to read data from various sources such as CSV, Parquet, etc. For example, to load a CSV file:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "data = spark.read.csv('path/to/your/data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: Initialize FLAML with Spark\n",
      "Initialize FLAML with Spark by passing the SparkSession object to the `AutoML` constructor:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "automl = AutoML(spark=spark)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 6: Train and optimize your model\n",
      "Use the `automl.fit` method to train and optimize your model:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "settings = {\n",
      "    \"time_budget\": 60,  # total running time in seconds\n",
      "    \"metric\": 'accuracy',  # primary metric for optimization\n",
      "    \"task\": 'classification',  # task type\n",
      "    \"log_file_name\": 'flaml.log',  # flaml log file\n",
      "}\n",
      "automl.fit(data, **settings)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 7: Get the best model and its hyperparameters\n",
      "After the optimization process is complete, you can retrieve the best model and its hyperparameters using the `automl.best_model` and `automl.best_config` attributes, respectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "best_model = automl.best_model\n",
      "best_config = automl.best_config\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 8: Terminate the SparkSession\n",
      "Finally, terminate the SparkSession to release the resources:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "spark.stop()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
